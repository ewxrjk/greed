GREED
=====

This is Greed, a GROGGS reader for Emacs.

Installation
------------

There are three ways you can install Greed.

.deb Installation
-----------------

Use this method if you are using a Debian, Ubuntu or similar system
and are the system administrator:

To build:
  debian/rules build
  fakeroot debian/rules install
  sudo dpkg -i ../groggs-greed-*.deb

Greed should then be available to all users, perhaps after they have
restarted their Emacs.

System-wide Installation
------------------------

Use this method if you are the system administrator of a
non-.deb-based system:

To install manually:
   ./configure
or if that does not correctly guess where to put files on your installation:
   ./configure --with-emacs=EMACS-PROGRAM \
               --with-lispdir=/path/to/site-lisp \
               --with-infodir=/path/to/info
and then:
  make
  sudo make install

Each user that wants to use Greed should then add the following line
to their ~/.emacs file:

  (autoload 'greed "greed" "Read Groggs" t)

Personal Installation
---------------------

Use this method if you are no the system administrator of the system
you want to read GROGGS from.

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-dot-emacs
  make
  make install

The 'make install' phase will update your ~/.emacs file.  Omit the
--with-dot-emacs option if you don't want it to do this.

Installing Greed
****************

In order to run Greed, you will a copy of GNU Emacs or XEmacs (version
19.20 or later) with network and process support.


Your e-mail address
===================

Greed needs to know your e-mail address, which should be stored in the
variable `user-mail-address'.  If this is incorrect (type `C-h v
user-mail-address RET' to see the value of the variable) you'll need to
add a line to your `.emacs' file to change it.  For example:

     (setq user-mail-address "me@my.host.name")


Using an existing Greed installation
====================================

You need to know the location of the three files `greed.elc',
`greed-md5.elc' and `greed.info', and make sure that the first two
files are in a directory listed in the variable `load-path' and the
third is in a directory listen in variable
`Info-default-directory-list'.

For example, if the directories are `/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp/' and
`/usr/info/' respectively, then you would put the following in your
`.emacs' file:

     (setq load-path (cons "/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp/" load-path))
     (setq Info-default-directory-list
           (cons "/usr/info/" Info-default-directory-list))

You also need to add the following line to your `.emacs' file:

     (autoload 'greed "greed" "Read Groggs" t)

To run Greed, start Emacs and type `M-x greed RET'.


Files in the Greed distribution
===============================

If Greed is not installed, you need to fetch the Greed distribution,
which should come with the following files:

`greed.el'
     The Greed program in Emacs LISP
`greed-md5.el'
     The MD5 Message Digest program in Emacs LISP
`greed-help-macro.el'
     A port of help-macro.el to XEmacs.
`README'
     Installation manual
`greed.texi'
     Texinfo source for the Greed manual
`Makefile'
     Makefile for compiling and testing


Quick installation
==================

Unpack the greed distribution, and type `make install' at the shell
prompt.  The Emacs LISP files will be put in the directory `~/elisp/',
the Info manual in the directory `~/info/' and your `.emacs' file will
be updated.  To run Greed, start Emacs and type `M-x greed RET'.


Advanced installation.
======================

  1. If necessary, edit the file `greed.el' and change the declaration
     of the `greed-servers' variable to the appropriate value(s) for
     your system.  *Note Server list::, for a description of the
     contents of this variable.  The default value of this variable
     should be fine if you intend to connect only to the Cambridge
     Groggs server.

  2. Edit the definition of `UPDATE_DOT_EMACS' in the file `Makefile'.
     Set it to `true' if you want your `.emacs' file to be automatically
     updated (and if so, omit steps 3 and 5), or anything else if you
     don't.

  3. Edit the definitions of `ELISPDIR' and `INFODIR' in the file
     `Makefile'.  `ELISPDIR' is the directory in which you keep Emacs
     LISP programs: it must be on the Emacs variable `load-path'; if
     necessary add a new directory to `load-path' by putting

          (setq load-path (cons "~/elisp/" load-path))

     or something similar in your `.emacs' file.  `INFODIR' is the
     directory in which you keep Info documentation: it must be on the
     Emacs variable `Info-default-directory-list'; if necessary add a
     new directory to `Info-default-directory-list' by putting

          (setq Info-default-directory-list 
                (cons "~/info/" Info-default-directory-list))

     or something similar in your `.emacs' file.

  4. Run `make install'.

  5. Put the following in your `.emacs' file:

          (autoload 'greed "greed" "Read Groggs" t)

The Info documentation describes the installation and use of Greed.
Once you have compiled and installed the Info documentation, type `C-h i
g (greed) RET' in Emacs to read it.
