GREED
=====

This is Greed, a GROGGS reader for Emacs.  If you don't know what
GROGGS is, see this URL:
  http://www.groggs.group.cam.ac.uk/

Requirements
------------

  You will need Emacs installed.  GNU Emacs and XEmacs should both
  work.  If you have a choice between a MULE and a non-MULE version,
  you should use the MULE version.

  Very old versions of Emacs may not work.

  Aquamacs is not currently supported.

Installation
------------

There are three ways you can install Greed.

  .deb Installation
  -----------------

  Use this method if you are using a Debian, Ubuntu or similar system
  and are the system administrator.

  Either get the .deb from the web site, or build it from source as
  follows:
    debian/rules build
    fakeroot debian/rules install
  In either case install it as follows:
    sudo dpkg -i ../groggs-greed-*.deb

  Greed should then be available to all users (regardless of which
  version of Emacs they use), perhaps after they have restarted their
  Emacs.

  System-wide Installation
  ------------------------

  Use this method if you are the system administrator of a
  non-.deb-based system:

  To install manually:
     ./configure
  or if that does not correctly guess where to put files on your
  installation:
     ./configure --with-emacs=EMACS-PROGRAM \
		 --with-lispdir=/path/to/site-lisp \
		 --with-infodir=/path/to/info
  In either case, then:
    make
    sudo make install

  Each user that wants to use Greed should then add the following line
  to their ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'greed "greed" "Read Groggs" t)

  If you want to support multiple versions of Emacs then you will
  probably have to make multiple installations of Greed.

  You can remove the Greed installation as follows:
    sudo make uninstall

  Personal Installation
  ---------------------

  Use this method if you are no the system administrator of the system
  you want to read GROGGS from.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-dot-emacs
    make
    make install

  The 'make install' phase will update your ~/.emacs file.  Omit the
  --with-dot-emacs option if you don't want it to do this.

  You can remove the Greed installation as follows:
    make uninstall

Using Greed
-----------

  Greed needs to know your e-mail address, which should be stored in the
  variable `user-mail-address'.  If this is incorrect (type `C-h v
  user-mail-address RET' to see the value of the variable) you'll need
  to change it, for instance by typing:

    M-x customize-variable RET user-mail-address RET

  and following the instructions in the customization buffer.
