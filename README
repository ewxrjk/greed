GREED
=====

This is Greed, a GROGGS reader for Emacs.

Installation
------------

There are three ways you can install Greed.

  .deb Installation
  -----------------

  Use this method if you are using a Debian, Ubuntu or similar system
  and are the system administrator:

  To build:
    debian/rules build
    fakeroot debian/rules install
    sudo dpkg -i ../groggs-greed-*.deb

  Greed should then be available to all users, perhaps after they have
  restarted their Emacs.

  System-wide Installation
  ------------------------

  Use this method if you are the system administrator of a
  non-.deb-based system:

  To install manually:
     ./configure
  or if that does not correctly guess where to put files on your
  installation:

     ./configure --with-emacs=EMACS-PROGRAM \
		 --with-lispdir=/path/to/site-lisp \
		 --with-infodir=/path/to/info
  and then:
    make
    sudo make install

  Each user that wants to use Greed should then add the following line
  to their ~/.emacs file:

    (autoload 'greed "greed" "Read Groggs" t)

  Personal Installation
  ---------------------

  Use this method if you are no the system administrator of the system
  you want to read GROGGS from.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-dot-emacs
    make
    make install

  The 'make install' phase will update your ~/.emacs file.  Omit the
  --with-dot-emacs option if you don't want it to do this.


Using Greed
-----------

  Greed needs to know your e-mail address, which should be stored in the
  variable `user-mail-address'.  If this is incorrect (type `C-h v
  user-mail-address RET' to see the value of the variable) you'll need
  to change it, for instance by typing:

    M-x customize-variable RET user-mail-address RET

  and following the instructions in the customization buffer.
