	* greed.el: highlighting of index and item buffers (ages ago, but
	I didn't write a changelog)
	(greed-index-mouse-item): mouse click in the index and the item is
	selected.  Click again on the same item and it scrolls.  It
	doesn't chain to the next item or anything at the end though -
	this is deliberate, to stop confusion regarding where the mouse is
	then pointing.
	(greed-item-buffer-name): make item buffers visible (i.e. not have
	a space at the beginning).  GNU Emacs won't fontify invisible
	buffers even if they are actually displayed.

	* use standard ChangeLog format
