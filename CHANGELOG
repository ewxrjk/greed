Version 1.1 (January 1996)
Killing an item while displaying all items moves cursor correctly
Continuations (forward and backward) are now represented by pointers in
  the data structures, not by itemid strings

Version 1.0 (17/11/95)

  that the blame for slow startup can be passed to the server or network)
